# RR_Course

Material from RR course in Dortmund:

- The folder `SAS` contains the source and the resulting files (Word doc, PDF and HTML) 
  from a markdown knitr document that was used in conjunction with SAS.
- `.gitignore` is the file that contains patterns for the files that should be ignored by git.
- `RR_Course.Rproj` contains the project setup from RStudio.
- `first_knitr.R` is the result from running `purl` on the knitr document `first_knitr.Rnw`.
- `first_knitr.Rnw` is the main knitr document as produced in the course 
  (with some small changes and better documentation).
- `markdown.Rmd` is a very basic markdown document.
- `hello_world.R` is a short R program to simply show how to use version control with git.
